The ceremony will differ depending on the couple’s focus which could be on Buddha, Dharma, nature, God, or creation. The ceremony is not focused on religion, but rather the couple’s promise to each other to live a harmonious and spiritual life.",

            "Prior to the wedding ceremony, the couple might visit a Buddhist monk to make sure that their horoscopes are aligned and show that they are a compatible couple. There is a traditional betrothal ceremony called a Chessian which might be held to celebrate the wedding.",

            "The ceremony will focus on meditation and moments of silence which creates a inner peace. A shrine might be erected with an image of Buddah surrounded by candles and flowers. Refuges and precepts are repeated by the bride and groom after the officiant. It can be personal things which individualizes the ceremony. The bride and groom might offer up a poem or a song that shows their love for each other. Buddhist wedding vows are repeated out of the Sigilovdda Sutta."
